            <br>
            <span>Recent statistics from The Week state that the rate of inflation in the UK has risen to 7% over the past year. This has been the largely attributed to the energy crisis, supply and demand issues, and staff shortages during COVID-19.</span>
            <span>An average cost of living in the UK is between £1000-1600/pcm as a student, rent being one of the biggest expenses. Along with the energy crisis, the bills increased with 28% making the year 2022 an ‘year of squeeze’ as Resolution Foundation reported on the 29th December.</span>
